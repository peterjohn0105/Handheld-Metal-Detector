The handheld metal detector is designed for the <a href="http://www.eastimagesecurity.com/faq/faq_3.shtml">walkthrough metal detectors</a>ying metal objects. They can easily find the weapons, explosive and small size of metal objects from packs, luggage, mails fabric and etc. The specially designed shape of the handheld metal detector makes it convenient to use. This is much better than the traditional metal detectors with loop sensor. Great sensitive of handheld metal detector make it possible to use in many special condition. For example, they can be used in prisons, archaeological studies, hospital and etc.

The handheld metal detector can be single used to detect the exact place when the  <a href="http://www.eastimagesecurity.com/faq/faq_3.shtml">waterproof metal detector</a>ides, they can also cooperate with walk through metal detectors to realize effective detection. When the walk through metal detectors give an alarm that there are metal objects, the handheld metal detector can find the exact place where the metal objects hide. Generally, handheld metal detector use rectangle head which owns twelve-centimeter-long surveyed area. When detecting human bodies, we can cover the area that we want to detector from the top to the bottom only one time with the handheld metal detector. However, to make sure more accurate location of metal objects, we often make a more comprehensive detection. The working principle of handheld metal detector is not complex.

It is based on electro-magnetic induction. The metal detector runs alternating current through the coil to <a href="http://www.eastimagesecurity.com/company.shtml">luggage detector factory</a> produce rapidly changing magnetic field. The magnetic field may make the metal objects produce induced eddy current. This eddy current would also produce magnetic field which may influence the original magnetic field on the contrary. In this way, the metal detectors can detector all the metal objects without any exception. The use of handheld metal detector is also very easy. The security staffs hold the hand shank pushing the start button with their thumb then loosen. The signal lamp begins to twinkle. At the same time, the device becomes quite slightly made. Then the security staffs scan customs with open metal detectors. After detection, we should push the power off bottom in order to waste the electricity quantity of the batteries. According to physiologic research, people are not very sensitive to the volume, but they are very sensitive to the tone. In this way, many handheld metal detectors change the tone of alarm to tell the size of the metal objects. It is an advantage differs from productions.

According to my detail introduction, I believe you have known that the function and methods of use of <a href="http://www.eastimagesecurity.com/company.shtml">X Ray baggage scanner company</a>.
